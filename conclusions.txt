CONCLUSIONS FROM BACKGROUND DATA

TOTAL INTAKE	
While the total number of dogs and cats is close to being equal at intake, with dogs
being about 7% higher, the type of intake varies between dogs and cats greatly.

Dogs approx 53%
Cats approx 45.8%
Other 1.2%

OWNER SURRENDER
For Dogs Owner Surrender is by far the largest percentage of type of Intake.  For
Cats Owner Surrender is close to the same percentage as are brought in as strays.  

Dogs 73%
Cats 38.8% 

STRAYS
Over three times as many strays taken in at HSWC are cats compared to dogs.
(Stray reclaims have been eliminated from the calculation.)

Dogs 9.7%
Cats 36.3%

ACO/POLICE AND PUBLIC DROP OFF 
As percenta of all strays brought in by the public or by an Animal Control Officer
or Police, cats make up nearly three quarters of the total number of strays.  1.5%
of cats and dogs combined represent animals that were abandoned at the facility.

Dogs 22.9%
Cats 71.1% (with an additional 4% born in care)

These statistics bear out the need to focus on Free Roaming Cats (FRC) for funding
spay/neuter programs.
